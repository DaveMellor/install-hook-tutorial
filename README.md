# install-hook-tutorial
Learning from Kyrofa - hook-tutorial (Linux is not my speciality) NO SHIT :)
I cam across this code snippet by chance and it caught my attention.  

I am unfamiliar with this 'hook' technique and the way script files can be used.
So - thank you Kyrofa for the lesson.

If in the unlikely event that I discover something I'll let you know.
